# odin-recipes

Welcome to my first project with HTML and CSS. The tone of this recipe website is intended to be comedic and humorous, taking inspiration from the Odin Project. Through this project, it has strengthen my understanding of programming languages and established a fundamental base for taking on more complex and advanced projects in the future. While it is now complete, I may revisit and improve or even recreate this project in the future. But for now, it stands as a finished project.
